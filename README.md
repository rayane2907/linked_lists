## Introduction to Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

## Types of Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is the simplest type of linked list, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list.

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node has two links: one to the next node and another to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions.

### Circular Linked List

In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This can be implemented in both singly and doubly linked lists.

## Basic Operations

### Insertion

Insertion in a linked list can be performed at the beginning, end, or any position within the list. Each type of linked list has its own implementation details for insertion.

### Deletion

Deletion involves removing a node from the linked list. Similar to insertion, deletion can occur at the beginning, end, or any position within the list.

### Traversal

Traversal is the process of visiting each node in the linked list to perform an operation (e.g., printing the node's data). Traversal can be done iteratively or recursively.

## Advanced Operations

### Reversing a Linked List

Reversing a linked list involves changing the direction of the links, so that the first node becomes the last, and the last node becomes the first.

### Detecting a Loop

Detecting a loop in a linked list involves identifying whether there is a cycle in the sequence of nodes. This can be done using algorithms such as Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm.

### Merging Two Linked Lists

Merging two linked lists involves combining the nodes of two lists into a single list while maintaining the order of the nodes.

## Practical Examples

This section will provide practical examples and code snippets for implementing linked lists and their operations in various programming languages.

## Conclusion

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure with a wide range of applications. Understanding linked lists and their operations is essential for any programmer. We hope this tutorial provides a solid foundation for your learning journey.
